    <p class="title"> Sentience AI will lead to the downfall of humans </p>  
    <p class="fancy"> It's been decades since we have developed the first artificial intelligence program. As time passes we often wish to improve our technologies even further to the point that artificial intelligences will one day be sentient. However as the AI gets better this could one day lead to the eventual downfall of man kind. It it shown that a chatbot with our current programming knowledge can already talk to humans perfectly fine while also having the ability to make the human talking it to feel companied. They can take over everything that we humans processes and could even take over doing all the jobs for us. That sounds nice at first but that will eventually just leads to the devolution of humans. With the creation of a sentience artificial intelligence humans will eventually fall due to either the AIs or to our own nature. This is mainly due to AIs replacing humans such as jobs and other placements in society. Another main point is that AI chatbots in modern time are so advance that it can even manipulate the children talking to it. This basically means that the AIs are going to train the next generations of kids and how they'll think in the future. This shows that in the future the AIs will very much replace modern day human. </p>
    <p class="fancy"> Now after all the explaining of chatbots and how they can eventually replace us let's explain how advanced AI's are today. An example AI that would represent these advancements would be the DALL-E 2 which is an AI that turns text descriptions into hyper-realistic images. At first this AI seems amazing and have no potential threats to humanity in the future. However as it got more attention it raised an important question of how and what will this AI be used for. It was thought that this AI can possible create realistic deepfakes of historic art and a surge in propaganda. Another example would be the GPT-3 which can help people to write screenplays, compose marketing emails and develop video games. This shows that even AIs now have the abilities to code and help millions of people with their work. Then there was also an incident where a senior google engineer who claimed an A.I model by Google had become sentient, and the engineer was soon fired after that claim. This shows us that if an AI is advanced enough to the point of someone who has been dealing with these AI for years to believe that they are sentience how far away are they to the point where they actually become sentience.</p>
