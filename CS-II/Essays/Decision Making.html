      <h3> Introduction</h3>
      <p> During a group project many factors can contribute to a single decision within the project. These factors are often due to the different bias of each group member. In our ISP this year our model scheduler frontend being a design focused project are going to include many different bias and each we'll have to figure a way to overcome it. In the rest of the essay we'll identify the different possible bias that could occur in our group/team and how we can overcome these inevitable factors. </p>
      
      <h3>Different Bias</h3>
      <p>The first major bias that could occur in our group would be the adjustment bias which is a common human judgement pattern that begins with an inital position. This is a major mainly due to that everyone has there own opinion to every scenerio there is and that's just how a human is now a days, it's inevitable. The second bias would be the complexity bias which is when factors such as time pressure, information overload, or other environmental factors contribute to the complexity of the tast. This would be a problem since due to our project being design focused we'll have many possibilites and these choices to easily result in the overload of information. However, this bias according to the yerkes dodson law which statese the relationship between pressure and performance which could be beneficial if we can control the stress level and the complexity of our project at a certain level. The third bias that could be quite common in these group projects would be the control bias because it's inevitable for someone wanting to control over whatever they're working on in their lives. Therefore, it is possible for the people in my group including me wanting to have control over the project and having our own ideas being the main design of the project which can then result in many arguments and even possible conflicts within the group. The fourth bias would be the desire bias which is similar to the control bias but it does not relate to past experience; rather it has to do with wishful thinking, outcome of the maker, and other factors such as greed. The bias could be quite common since everyone will have a certain desire for something within the project however, this could affect the quality of our project. The final bias that could occur within our group would be the habit bias which creates a decision based on the past and if it was used before. This could later result in problems such as the lack of creativity because some group members would not want try something new or use a simple/lame logo to represent our project(“Monash University School).</p>
      
      <h3> How to Overcome</h3>
      <p> Now we have identifed most of our decision bias, we can plan ahead to overcome these inevitable probelms. The most common and stright forward solution is more team communication. Communication are often the best way to solve almost any problem in a group project. With communcation we can overcome all the bias through compromises allowing each member to purpose an idea and to add some parts of the idea. This will allow us to decrease the bias of desire and control as well as adjustments considering each member had a role in the design. In addition to some other bias such as the complexity bias that includes elements such as stress levels could be overcome through better time management of our projects and creating goals for a more organized schedule. This allows our group members to have a lower stress level overall. However, for us to create these plans and allowing proper communcation through discussions we'll most likely pick and choose a group leader within our group that creates plans for our project and following every member's idea on the project and how it should be developed.</p>

      <h3> Conclusion </h3>
      <p> Decisiion bias are inevitabl, doesn't matter if the group is only doing a high school project with 3 people or it's a project in a large company with 30 people there will be some factors leading to a decision bias. However a majority of these challenges can often be overcome through simple communication.</p>
