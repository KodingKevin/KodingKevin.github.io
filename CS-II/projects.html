      <p> The concept of this game was supposed to be a horror game maze where the player enters the buildings and starts going through an "infinite" maze </p>
      <p> The original idea of the game was kind of like slenderman while being inside a building without a monster chasing you </p>
      <p> Players had to go through the maze to look for a certain room for find the artifacts </p>
      <p> once the player gathered all artifacts the game ends, simple </p>
      <p> However due to the limited time after having to change the overall theme I wasn't able to add jumpscares or sound effects as players go through the rooms</p>
      <h3> What have I learned</h3>
      <p> From last year of computer science I have learned some basics of coding and commands</p>
      <p> I also have learned how to use the emacs and shell</p>
      <p> I have learned to think more outside of the box</p>
      <h3> About My Code</h3>
      <p> For my code I need a lot of images so I used a static class to store all my image URLs so it's easier for me to access them.</p>
