      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/vivek-maranganti/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Code Translator</a>
      <p> The idea of translating code from code is interesting while also pretty difficult. This project interested me at first because it seemed challenging however I rejected at the end due to a few reasons. First it's not very original since there are many programs already out there that will translate code. This means as a business project it probably won't be bring out many benefits for us. Another reason would be that I don't see this as that purposeful of a program since like stated before it's just gonna be another one of the programs out there with nothing special to it.</p>
      
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/helen-giordano/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> AI chatbot</a>
      <p> This project interested me because I also thought about having an AI chatbot as my project. However the idea of an AI chatbot that just talks to you and ask questions isn't really anything that special. It also doesn't include that much of a purpose as a project since just talking and asking questions isn't really that special.</p>
      
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/gautam-narayan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Low frequency trading AI</a>
      <p> I considered this project because the sound of a trading AI interested me. However as I read through the describitions I find it hopefully but not something that I would want to do. This project includes economic elements which isn't something that I wanted to deal with. So overall, this project includes a meaningful purpose but it just isn't for me.</p>
      
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brett-kaplan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> School Food order application</a>
      <p> This project is in fact purposeful and meaningful for our school however there are still some problems with this project. First thing being that the project doesn't really resolve the issue of the slow line system since it can easily screw up the line if the system malfunctions and that would result in choas since people aren't getting there food. So the reason I'm rejecting this project is mainly due to the risk of it just not being that ideal.</p>
      
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/connor-church/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> DX3</a>
      <p>This project's idea is meaningful and quite helpful for people like me to study. However I don't really care about the problem that this project is trying to resolve since I don't really study that often anyways. Additionly keeping someone awake for a long time pass a normal bed time is more of a harm than anything. Therefore, I rejcted this project mainly due to the fact that it's not that usful for me.</p>
      
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/joshua-lee/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Facial Recognition</a>
      <p> This project is probably one of the many projects that I was close to accepting since it helps with attendance in classes lowering the chances of you being marked tardy or absence due to the teaching missing you. However the one thing that made me reject this project is that it's not the most optimal way to do it. This is becuase of the fact that people wear different things on their faces on a daily. Therefore, there is a high chance of the AI not recognize a person's face due to them wearing a mask or glasses on that day which could led to other problems.</p>
      
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/myoram-langwang/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Bolt</a>
      <p> This project's name interested me at first however I didn't find it that useful. It's basically just like any other social media apps that relate people to talk and connect with one another. Therefore I didn't see the project being that meaningful and that beneficial for the school or society.</p>
      
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrewm-lin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Cafe Project</a>
      <p> The cafe project is very useful for our school however similar to the other cafe project there are still some problems. These problems includes the chance of the system malfunctioning leading to chaos resulting in further problems with students not being able to get the food. Additionaly we won't know how reliable these systems and connections are going to be therefore, it's not that optimal of a project.</p>
      
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/tahmid-rahman/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> AeroFli</a>
      <p>This project includes an interesting AI idea which allows airlines to include AI pilots. This idea is meaningful however, it's not actually that beneficial in my opinion since if anything it would harm the society by taking over the pilot industry. Which can lead to many people losing their jobs.</p>
      
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/kevin-li/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Smart Shop</a>
      <p> I heavily considered this plan because of the complexity and the benefits it can bring. The benefits would include teachers no longer need to worry about attendances and students wouldn't be marked tardy accidently which has happened to me. Our thought process was to use an API that would do the heavy-lifting for us while we make requests to that API based of customer input. I feel that it is possible for us to do this project with time and patience.</p>
