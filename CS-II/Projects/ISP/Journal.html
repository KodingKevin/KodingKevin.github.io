      <h4> Project Improvements </h4>
      <p>So far the group has no really worked much on the project since the only thing we have left is some improvements. However, we have done some small edits on our styles, but so far we have not done much progress on the overall improvements of the model scheduler. </p>
      
      <h3> 20-Mar-2023 </h3>
      <h4> Project Feedback </h4>
      <p> SInce the ISP has been launched and most people have been using it we have also received a lot of feedback that could help us improve the model scheduler. So far the main thing we need to improve on would include on the styles and the scaling of the website since that's the main complaint along with some UI problems of the website. A possible example would be how our demand calculator is extremely buggy and kinda of just doesn't work even during the launch.</p>
      
      <h3> 13-Mar-2023 </h3>
      <h4> Project launch </h4>
      <p> We have completed the isp project at the end of this week due to the limited time it's not fully completed, but it will work and fulfill the purpose of a model scheduler. Now for our group because this was basically due on Friday most people went on a bull rush this week and tried to get as much in as we possibily can. Most people like our managers focused on the schedule page and the course selection page. However, I was mainly responsible for the FAQ page along with some minor roles for the other page to create some functions. Now a problem with our group is that even tho this week was going to be the last week we'll be able to work on it before the publish, I still haven't seen like 5 of the group members throughout this whole thing. This put a lot of the works on our managers as well as some of the other members. </p>

      <h4> Challenges </h4>
      <p> This week our ISP group faced the same challenges as before which is mainly communication. I have quite literally yet to see some of the members in our group and this scheduler is going to be published in like two weeks. This would result in some poeple to do more work than they are needed. For example, there is quite literally 5 people doing 70 percent of the work. To me this is a huge problem for a group project. In this last few weeks our manager will try to assign the last few required issues and try to get them to do something. This is probably the only challenge/problem that my group is still facing</p>
      <br>
      <h4> Contributions </h4>
      <p> This week I mainly was just preparing for the gifs that we'll be using in our ISP. In addition, I also had to discuss with my manager on how will the styles of the pages look and what changes need to made to the FAQ page, since that's what I'm mainly responible for. In the end we came to the idea that we need more graphics and the styles is good enough.</p>

      <h4> My progress on the ISP</h4>
      <p> This week I didn't really spend that much time on our ISP due to the amount of work I had to do for other classes. So this week I just fixed our css files and made some changes. These fixes would include how our navigation bar was moving around when the user move around pages. This is due to the fact that all the html pages had their own css file. So for me to fix this problem I had to edit most of the css files and try to fuse the files without any conflicts. In addition I also added some minor updates to the css files including the styles to our gifs that we'll use.</p>

      <h3> 13-Feb-2023 </h3>
      <h4> Challenges </h4>
      <p> This week we again have some schedule challenges due to the fact we have 20 people and half of the people are in different periods. This results in the lack of communication and some people being behind. Which results in another interpersonal challenge where some people are doing more than members. This is often not due to them not wanting to do anything, but instead it's due to how behind they are because of the lack of information and communication with the team. This would later result in the difficulties in catching people up with the project. To resolve this we should probably try to catch people up as fast as possible by trying to schedule like a meeting outside of school where people actually show up unlike last time where only half the group showed up.</p>

      <h3> 30-Jan-2023 </h3>
      <h4> What I have done </h4>
      <p> This is the first week that I started to actually work on the ISP and I'm mainly focused on designing the faq page since that's what the plan is. This week I have completed the mvp, minimum viable product, for the faq page as well as some basic styles for the navigationbars.</p>
      <h4> Challenges</h4>
      <p> The challenge we faced this week continue to be some communication difficulties due to the mass number of people in our group and how a lot of them are in different periods. This problems would result in difficulties in assigning roles and people's jobs. However, we have improved through the use of discord allowing us to reach some members that is not in our class period.</p>

      <h3> 23-Jan-2023 </h3>
      <h4> Challenges </h4>
      <p> This week we actually didn't really have any challenges due to the high amount of quizzes everyone had this week. However the schedule challenge still remain since like stated before we all have different schedules and we have a big group. We have tried to schedule a meeting outside of school however only a fourth of the people showed up. As a solution we might possibly just have some minor meetings with whoever can show up during that time. This would allow our managers to at least keep everyone on the same track.</p>
      <br> </br>
      
      <h3> 9-Jan-2023 </h3>
      <h4> Challenges </h4>
      <p> This week we had many technical challenges and these challenges mainly came from GitHub. Since this is basically the second week that we are working on our ISP we just started to use GitHub for communicate and project planning. However not many team members have used GitHub that often before including me. Therefore we had many problems such as the repository not linking, GitHub not working, etc. In addition we also remain our communication challenges due to the amount of group members we have. Even with the use of Discord we still lack some communication with many group members, so planning it would still remain a challenge. A way that we could resolve this issue would be try to meet up in person, doesn't have to be all members but ideally most of the members. This would allow us to fully acknowledge everyone in the group allowing better teamwork and less issues such as a group member falling behind the problem and doesn't know what to do.</p>
      
      <br> </br>
      <h3> 2-Jan-2023</h3>
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <p> Our first ever challenge would be the schedules of all the team members. Considering that we'll have 20 people overall working on this model scheduler it will be fairly difficult to communicate with each other. In addition it would be difficult to gather everyone to discuss about the project considering how everyone have a different class period. After discussing with some of the group members we have decided to use technology and use the discord app and the github website to communicate with each other. However the one down side of this plan would be the chance of someone not having access technology and therefore not be able to use the app to communicate with the team. </p>
      
      <h4> Role Research </h4>
      <p>Development Engineer - This role is responsible with the leading design and the product of this group. I personally think I'm suitable for this role considering I often like to start with an idea and improving as we go.</p>
      <p>QA Engineer -   This role is responsible for the quality of the product and in this case is to make sure that there isn't any error within the project. In other words the QA Engineer are the debuggers of the team. I think I'm suitable for this role as well however decoding and debugging has never been my strong suit.</p>
      <p>Project Manager - This role is responsible to make plans and that all task are delivered properly within the group. This role requires someone to have skills such as leadership and team management. However these traits I don't obtain which mean I would not be suitable for this role.</p>
      <p>Product Manager - This role is responsible for the overall development of product and is like the brain of the team that creates the different ideas. This role also comes great responsibility along with the project manager and as someone who stress a lot I would say this role isn't suitable for me.</p>
      <p>Release Engineer  - This role is responsible to make proper judgement on whether or not the product is ready to be released. This role requires someone to have some overall experience so they can make the proper call on the project. As someone who's basically an amature in this field and have basically no experience I would not be that suitable for this role.</p>
