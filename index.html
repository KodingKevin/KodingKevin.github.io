      <h1> My Portfolio </h1>
      <h2>Contact: kevin.li@student.allenisd.org</h2>
      <h3> Why is it important </h3>
      <p > Many including myself would question why should I make a digital portfolio and why is it important. Well a digital portfolio will provide and display the necessary information required to inform whoever is reading this right now what kind of person I am. This can be useful when you are going through multiple interviews for a job. You'll be able to show this portfolio to whoever is interviewing and they'll determine if you are set for this job based on your about me portfolio. Which means this portfolio is really important to me because my future job will be depending on this page.</p>
      <h3> About who I am </h3>
      <p > First for an introduction, my name is Kevin Li currently as I write this paragraph I am at the age of 16. I was born in New York, Brooklyn near China town. I went to China at the age of 2 and came Texas at the age of 5 meaning my English was terrible when I was a kid. However, my english have obviously improved since I am typing this paragraph right now. When I was elementary there are many times when the teachers or adults would ask what do I want to be when I grow up. My first ever choice of my future job was something computer related, and I still stay by that to this day. Many would ask what makes me want to face a computer all day and type codes, and my answer was simply because programming and hacking were just really cool to me. However another major reason was that computers are like a comfort zones to me. I have been an introvert ever since I was a kid and will become extremely anxious around random people. And that is why I am learning how to code and how I can persue the path of computer science. So in conclusion Who am I? I'm just another one out of the thousands of people who wants to learn computer science and that is it. </p>
      <h3> My Skills </h3>
      <p> Skills plays a major part of if you are going to get the job you want. It doesn't matter if it's a soft skill or a hard skill it can help. For me however, I don't got a lot unique skills. My skills would I guess include I'm good with patterns and logic, I'm patient, can manage my time pretty well, and I'm loyal. Some side skills would include me being Chinese and have the ability and speak chinese and have taken courses such as physics and psychology.</p>
