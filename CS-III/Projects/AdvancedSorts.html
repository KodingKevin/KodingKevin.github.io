      <h3>Merge Sort</h3>
      <p> Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that uses divide and conquer by creating two sorted subarrays to correctly sort a given list of numbers known as an arrays. This is also considered one of the fastest sorting algorithms. For the process the sort will divide the given array into two seperate subarrays and then sort each half of the subarray individually. Once the subarrays are sorted the algorithm will merge the two arrays together into it's original form. It will then check if the given array is sorted correctly. If it's not then it'll repeat the process again until it is correctly sorted.  </p> 
      
      <h3>Quick Sort</h3>
      <p> Similar to Merge sort, Quick sort also uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm, however, it is a bit different. This recursive algorithm is considered more efficient than even merge sort. The first steps of the process would be to choose the highest index value has pivot, which is a choosen value from the array used to compare other values that could potentially be lower or greater. Then second step would be to take two variables to point left and right of the array excluding pivot. Then step 3 and 4 would be to move the left points to the low index and the right points to the high index. Now step 5 and 6 while value at left is less than pivot move right and while value at right is greater than pivot move left. Now step 7 if both step 5 and step 6 does not match swap left and right. Finally, if left is greater or equal to right, the point where they met is the new pivot value. Repeat the process until the array is entirely sorted correctly. </p>
      
      <h3> Heap Sort</h3>
      <p> This is a comparison-based sorting algorithm unlike the other two it is based on Binary Heap data structure. However, it is similar to selection sort but more improved where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning but it does not waste time with a linear-time scan of the unsorted region. Heap sort maintains the unsorted region in a heap data structure to move more quickly finding the largest element in each step. Now for the steps before the sorting to take place it reorders the array elements to satisfy the heap property. Then it uses a binary tree structure to map out the array index where the index is the node's parent, left child branch, or right child branch are simple expressions. </p>
