      <h2>BYOD removal </h2>
      <h3> 2-May-2023</h3>
      <p> The BYOD policies forces students to bring their school issued devices which allows the school to block off and regulate the programs that student's use. This restricts the freedom of student's use on computers while also blocking off many useful resources. In my computer science class it provides a great example where they blocked off the terminals such as secure shell, although it is true that we still have some stuff like tabby but it isn't the same as a real terminal. In addition, there are times when even codermerlin is blocked for no reason which leads to many difficulties. In other words, it is important to regulate what student's are doing on their computers, but it is not necessary to block off every possible program and resource possible. Overall, this change is pretty bad for many students who have their own device and wish to use it for their own convenience.</p>
