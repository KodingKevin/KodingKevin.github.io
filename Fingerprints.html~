    <h3 class="fancy">  As we develop our data networks and connect we developed a new HTTPS connection. This HTTPS connection has two primary purpose which is to enhance the user's security and privacy. However as the use of this new HTTPS connection private institutions such as schools and other organizatons weren't that pleased because they are no longer to track the student's uses of internet. They later responded to this loss of visibility by deploying a new technology know as the HTTPS Proxy Appliances which provided them with the ability to see their employees' or student's internet usage. As we develop new connections there is also new kinds of problems such as the MITM which stands for man in the middle attack. This is a common cybersecurity attack that allows the attack to eavesdrop between the two targets. This problem presents a risk of leak information and privacy. However this attack can be detected through a hash. Hashes are a complex mathematical algorithms which carefully process every single bit of contect it takes in. A good hash would have a good hashing algorithm with a high detection ability and security. There is also the CA which stands for certification authorities and they are the ones that proves a website of their identity in the real physical world using incorporation documentations. However a website could later get scanned by a SSL Interception which means that it can no longer be absolutely trusted since it's alreayd been decrypted. Now some may ask if there's a way to prevent it, and no there isn't. However this can be detected through the use of keys. Their are usually two keys, a private and a public which are a cryptographically matched pairs. This would detect a SSL interception because a private key is only available on the remote server and the SSL is forced to use a different public key which is always making it different. Now after talking about the SSL Interceptions, it's time for the false positives and false negatives in a website. A false positive usually means that it shows something is there while it's not. A false negative would just be the opposite which is an error that shows something is not present when it is. Now after all this talk about privacy and connections and stuff. Let's think about our schools and governement. There are many arguments about if a school or the government have the rights to eavesdrop on our communications. Which in my opinion, no they do not because it simply just invades my personally privacy as well as going against the law of personal rights. This goes the same for the government even if it's for protection.</h3>
